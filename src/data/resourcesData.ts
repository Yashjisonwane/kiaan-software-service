While both are powerful, their execution models are diametrically opposed. Node.js runs on Chrome's V8 engine utilizing a single-threaded, non-blocking asynchronous event loop.

Its event loop can handle tens of thousands of concurrent connections on tiny hardware footprints because threads aren't blocked waiting for database queries to return." },
            { heading: "CPU Bound Systems: The Python Advantage", content: "However, if your system involves heavy computational lifting—such as processing massive CSV files, generating complex PDF reports, resizing images, or algorithmic trading predictions—Node.js will notoriously block its single thread, stalling the entire application.
