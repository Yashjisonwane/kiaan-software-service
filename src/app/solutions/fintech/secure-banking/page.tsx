            answer: "Our React and Angular architectures are built to strictly prevent XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) and CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery). We enforce strict Content Security Policies (CSP), utilize HttpOnly secure cookies for session management, and conduct automated OWASP vulnerability scanning during CI/CD."

        {
            question: "Can your dashboards handle high-frequency data streams?",
            answer: "Yes. For dashboards requiring live market data or massive transaction volumes, we bypass standard REST polling. Instead, we implement optimized WebSocket connections combined with React Server Components or virtualized lists to render thousands of rows without dropping browser frames."
