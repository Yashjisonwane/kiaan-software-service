            answer: "For maximum execution speed in High-Frequency Trading (HFT), we utilize C++ and Rust for the core execution engine. For strategy logic, dashboarding, and API management, we often utilize Node.js or Python depending on your algorithmic complexity and machine learning requirements."

            question: "How do you secure API keys and user funds?",
            answer: "API keys are never stored in plaintext. We utilize AWS Key Management Service (KMS) or HashiCorp Vault with AES-256 encryption. Our architecture ensures the bot only has the minimum necessary permissions (e.g., trading only, no withdrawal rights)."
